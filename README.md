This is a simple To-Do app where you can manage daily tasks. You can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) your todos using a user-friendly interface built with React JS and Bootstrap. React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS libraries for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. With this app, you can easily mark them as completed or pending, edit them as you wish, and delete them when you are done.

### Technologies used: React JS, Bootstrap

To create a new task, click the (+) button and add a 'To-Do' item to your list. If you want to correct or modify a task, use the button with the pencil icon. To delete a task, click the trash button next to it. To mark a task as complete, just check the box next to it.
